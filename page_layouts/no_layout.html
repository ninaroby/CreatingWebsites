    <p>This paragraph has no layout property applied and so it will stretch
        out as wide as the screen will allow.  This is not a good way to
        display your content, as it is not good design for readability
        purposes.  If you notice, the footer has jumped up to the bottom of
        the paragraph: this is because there is no height on the paragraph
        and it simply takes on the height required to display the content.
