        <h2>Position</h2>

        <p>The position property is important to understand, if you are going
            to create effective page layouts.  There are 4 properties that
            you should understand well.
         </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Static</li>
            <li>Relative</li>
            <li>Fixed</li>
            <li>Absolute</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Static</h2>
        <div class="static">Static is the default value for positioning.  If
            you don't position an element it is "static" and therefore "not
            positioned"
        </div>
        <h2>Relative</h2>
        <div class="relative">When you set an element with the  position of
            relative, it will be relative to it's own natural place in the
            document:"relative to itself".  So this div is set to
            position:relative<br>
            top:10px<br>
            left:10px<br>
            This means that it will display 10px down and 10px left from
            where it would be in the document flow.
        </div>

        <h2>Fixed</h2>
        <div>This is a tricky one for use on the mobile
            platform.  Essentially, if you position an element as fixed, it
            will stick to the screen window in that position.  The element
            stuck to the bottom, right of the screen is 'position: fixed' and no
            matter how much you scroll, it will remain there!
        </div>

        <div class="fixed">
            Hi, there, I am fixed here!
            Still here!
        </div>

        <h2>Absolute</h2>
        <div class="positioned">
            <p class="bottom">The box on the right is set to an absolute
                position of:<br>
                top:-10px<br>
                right:15px</p>
        <div class="absolute">This is where you can control the exact
            position of an element, relative to the nearest positioned
            element.<br>
        </div>
        </div>
